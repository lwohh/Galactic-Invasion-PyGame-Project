# GALACTIC INVASION
Galactic Invasion is a PyGame project I created alongside three classmates in University
- Galactic Invasion is a 2D Arcade shooter based on the arcade classic Space Invaders
- The goal is to shoot down alien ships attempting to invade your planet as quickly as possible


**I am credited with**:
  - _Sprite animations_
  - _Menu creation and traversal_
  - _OOP Framework transition (originally more functional before learning OOP w/ PyGame)_
  - _Game Mechanics (player/enemy movement, power-ups, end-conditions, etc.)_
  - _Level creation and traversal_
  - _High-score system implementation_
