# GALACTIC INVASION
Galactic Invasion is a PyGame project I created alongside three classmates in University
- Galactic Invasion is a 2D Arcade shooter based on the arcade classic Space Invaders
- The goal is to shoot down alien ships attempting to invade your planet as quickly as possible

I am credited with:
  - Sprite animations
  - Menu creation and traversal
  - OOP Framework transition (originally more functional before learning OOP w/ PyGame)
  - Game Mechanics (player/enemy movement, power-ups, end-conditions, etc.)
  - Level creation and traversal
  - High-score system implementation
