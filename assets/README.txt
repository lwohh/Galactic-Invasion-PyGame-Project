CCSE 1321 W02: Amy Long, Canyon White, Christian Mason, Hector Nava



Welcome to GALACTIC INVASION!
Our game is a simple but addicting twist on an arcade classic.

You will be piloting a ship attempting to stop the invasion of your home planet by disastrous aliens.
These aliens are sending fighters towards the planet, and you must shoot them out of the atmosphere before they reach the planet. 

Should an alien reach your planet, your mission will have failed, and you along with your world will perish!



GOAL:
The goal of GALACTIC INVASION is to achieve the highest score possible, while managing the defeat all the enemies on screen.



Gameplay Mechanics:
- Galactic Invasion contains up to twelve unique levels, with the enemy difficulty increasing as time progresses.

- In roughly 10 second intervals, the spawn rate of the enemy aliens will increase by 150ms (0.15 seconds), starting at 3500ms (3.5 seconds)

- For every alien ship destroyed, your score will increase by 1

- The level will increase by 1 every 20 score obtained
	- with every new level, a new background is shown

- A BOSS alien will spawn once at the beginning of every level, it will move faster, and jump farther down the screen, making it harder to defeat

- At random intervals of 20-30 seconds, POWER-UPS will be dropped from the screen, and can affect various aspects of the game 
	- either your character will move faster, or the bullets you shoot will move faster
	- power-ups conditions last roughly 15 seconds before returning to normal

- The game contains a semi-persistent high-score board. as long as the game does not fully close (by pressing escape in the main menu, or clicking the X button) your top 20 scores will be persistent on the leaderboard labeled 1-20

- END CONDITION: if an alien goes below the bottom of the screen, the game will automatically end, sending you to the leaderboard to see your top 20 scores
