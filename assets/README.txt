CCSE 1321 W02: Amy Long, Canyon White, Christian Mason, Hector Nava



Welcome to GALACTIC INVASION!
Our game is a simple but addicting twist on an arcade classic.

You will be piloting a ship attempting to stop the invasion of your home planet by disastrous aliens.
These aliens are sending bombs towards the planet, and you must shoot them out of the atmosphere before they reach the planet. 

Should a bomb reach your planet, your mission will have failed, and you along with your world will perish!


GOAL:
The goal of GALACTIC INVASION is to achieve the highest score possible, while managing the defeat all the enemies on screen.


Gameplay Mechanics:
- Galactic Invasion contains multiple levels, with the difficulty increasing as time progresses.

- In roughly 10 second intervals, the spawn rate of the enemy bombs will increase by 150ms

- For every bomb destroyed, your score will go up by 1

- The level will increase by 1 every 20 score obtained

- A BOSS bomb will spawn once at the beginning of every level, it will move faster, and jump farther down the screen 
  making it harder to manage

- At random intervals of 20-30 seconds, POWER-UPS will be dropped from the screen, and can affect various aspects of the game

- END CONDITION: if a bomb goes below the bottom of the screen, the game will automatically end
